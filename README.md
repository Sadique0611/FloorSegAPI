# FloorSegAPI
A FastAPI-based application for segmenting 2D floor plans into functional spaces (rooms, kitchens, etc.) using a U-Net model built with PyTorch. Developed during my internship at LeanPort Digital Technologies GmbH, this project showcases AI-driven image segmentation and API development.

Length: 135 characters (GitHub’s limit is ~512, but shorter is better for readability).
Key Elements: Mentions the project’s goal (floor plan segmentation), technologies (FastAPI, PyTorch, U-Net), context (internship), and skills (AI, API development).
